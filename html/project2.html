        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>The GPU Clicker game is designed for Android platforms, featuring an engaging mechanic where users generate "threads" by tapping on a GPU. This simulates earning computational power, which can be used to upgrade equipment or buy new aesthetics for the game interface.</p>

        <img src="\assets\gpu-clicker-screen2.png" alt="Upgrades in GPU Clicker Game"> 
        <h2>Upgrade Mechanics</h2>
        <p>In the GPU Clicker game, players can purchase various upgrades that enhance their thread generation rate. These upgrades include new GPU models, cooling systems, and other enhancements that incrementally increase the passive thread collection or improve tap efficiency.</p>
    <br>
        <h2>Real-World Integration</h2>
        <p>The game includes a unique feature that integrates real-world weather conditions into gameplay. Utilizing location services, if it's raining in the player's area, they receive a "rainy day" bonus that temporarily boosts their thread production, adding an immersive layer to the game experience.</p>
    <br>
        <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
        <p>This application leverages several technologies including Android Studio for development, Java for backend processing, and Google's Fused Location Provider for accessing and using the device's location data to implement weather-based bonuses.</p>
